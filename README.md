# Udemy Course Spring Security Section1
## spring version: 3.4.4


## add Spring Security dependency
after start I see following in the console:

Using generated security password: 7ff51ebf-93ce-494d-b651-e2b4562d4594

This generated password is for development use only. Your security configuration must be updated before running your application in production.

## after adding the spring.security... properties 
the password is not generated anymore, and we use our credentials now.
